# 💻 OIBSIP_WebDevelopment_Task1 - Basic Calculator

## 📌 Task Overview

This project is part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program** under the Web Development domain. The objective was to build a **Basic Calculator** web application capable of performing standard arithmetic operations with a simple and responsive user interface.

---

## ✨ Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Real-time input and display
- `C` button to clear the entire input
- `DEL` button to remove the last character
- Handles errors in expression evaluation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and layout
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Functionality and logic

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. Users input values and operations through the on-screen buttons.
2. The current expression is shown in the display box.
3. Pressing `=` evaluates the result using JavaScript’s built-in `eval()` function.
4. The `C` button clears the display, while `DEL` removes the last character.
5. If an invalid expression is entered, an "Error" message is shown.
